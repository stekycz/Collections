## Description

Basic collections for PHP using arrays. It contains only `Set` now however I want to add some more collection types
(for example `Map`, `List`, etc.). All suggestions are welcome.

It requires **PHP >= 5.3.3**.

Basic methods are inspirated by [Java collections](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html)
but some methods are not used (for example `size()`, `iterator()`, etc.) because there is some equivalent in PHP (for example
`count()` in `Countable` interface).
